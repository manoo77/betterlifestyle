I"_<p>Your bones hang out in a ton of joints. Knee joints. Hip joints. The joints in your fingers and the joints in your toes.
Any place bones meet, there is an additional ligament, a rubbery, defensive layer that guarantees your joints twist easily and effortlessly. Be that as it may, even ligaments can’t do this enormous activity alone. A slim layer called the “synovium” gives liquid that greases up the moving pieces of the joint. At the point when the ligament wears out of the synovium gets kindled, the outcome is commonly an instance of “osteoarthritis” or “rheumatoid joint pain.”</p>
